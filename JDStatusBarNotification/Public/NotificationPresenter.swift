/**
 * The NotificationPresenter let's you present notifications below the statusBar.
 * You can customize the style (colors, fonts, etc.) and animations. It supports notch
 * and no-notch devices, landscape & portrait layouts and Drag-to-Dismiss. It can display a
 * title, a subtitle, an activity indicator, an animated progress bar & custom views out of the box.
 *
 * To customize the appearance, see the *Customize the style* section. To see all customization
 * options, see the ``StatusBarNotificationStyle`` documentation.
 *
 * While a notification is displayed, a separate window is presented on top of your application
 * window. Upon dismissal this window, its view controller and all its views are removed from
 * memory. The presenter class itself is a singleton which will stay in memory for the lifetime of
 * your application once it was created. The default ``StatusBarNotificationStyle`` and any styles
 * added by the user also stay in memory permanently.
